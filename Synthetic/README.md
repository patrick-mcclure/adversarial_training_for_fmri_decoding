# Adversarial Training for Decoding from Synthetic Images

Synthetic_Decoding.ipynb is an Jupyter Notebook that contains code to train, validate, and test decoding models for syntheitc images built to approximate fMRI activation maps. The notebook also contains code to compare the interpretability of the input gradients of each decoding model.

The "data" directory contains he data files used by the training, validation, and testing code.

The "saved_models" directory contains the model files created by the training code.
